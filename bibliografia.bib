	abstract="In addition to traditional Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE) poses a real challenge for Internet service providers, audio-visual services, broadcasters and new Over-The-Top (OTT) services. Therefore, objective audio-visual metrics are frequently being dedicated in order to monitor, troubleshoot, investigate and set benchmarks of content applications working in real-time or off-line. The concept proposed here, Monitoring of Audio Visual Quality by Key Performance Indicators (MOAVI), is able to isolate and focus investigation, set-up algorithms, increase the monitoring period and guarantee better prediction of perceptual quality. MOAVI artefacts Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are classified into four categories, based on their origin: capturing, processing, transmission, and display. In the paper, we present experiments carried out over several steps with four experimental set-ups for concept verification. The methodology takes into the account annoyance visibility threshold. The experimental methodology is adapted from International Telecommunication Union -- Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendations: P.800, P.910 and P.930. We also present the results of KPI verification tests. Finally, we also describe the first implementation of MOAVI KPI in a commercial product: the NET-MOZAIC probe. Net Research, LLC, currently offers the probe as a part of NET-xTVMS Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and Cable Television (CATV) monitoring system.",

	abstract="Rooted in statistical learning or Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory, support vector machines (SVMs) are well positioned to generalize on yet-to-be-seen data. The SVM concepts presented in Chapter 3can be generalized to become applicable to regression problems. As in classification, support vector regression (SVR) is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and VC control of the margin and the number of support vectors. Although less popular than SVM, SVR has been proven to be an effective tool in real-value function estimation. As a supervised-learning approach, SVR trains using a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates. Using Vapnik's -insensitive approach, a flexible tube of minimal radius is formed symmetrically around the estimated function, such that the absolute values of errors less than a certain threshold are ignored both above and below the estimate. In this manner, points outside the tube are penalized, but those within the tube, either above or below the function, receive no penalty. One of the main advantages of SVR is that its computational complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space. Additionally, it has excellent generalization capability, with high prediction accuracy.",
